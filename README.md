# La Liga Home Win Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome of home matches in La Liga using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical match data, including team performance, home/away status, and half-time scores, the model attempts to predict whether the home team will win. The project utilizes a Random Forest classifier to train the model and evaluate its performance based on accuracy and precision.

## Motivation
As a passionate soccer fan, I’ve always been fascinated by the dynamics of football matches and how various factors influence the outcome of a game. With Real Madrid being my favorite team of all time, it made perfect sense for me to focus on **La Liga**, the league that has been home to many unforgettable moments involving my beloved team. 

Predicting the outcomes of La Liga matches, particularly home games, felt like a natural fit. The dynamics of playing at home, the fan atmosphere, and historical performances are often key factors in a team’s success. With this project, I wanted to combine my love for soccer and my growing interest in data science to see if machine learning could accurately predict home wins in La Liga.

## Data
The dataset used for this project contains historical match data for La Liga, including the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the match.
- **HomeTeam**: The team playing at home.
- **AwayTeam**: The team playing away.
- **HTHG**: Half-time home goals.
- **HTAG**: Half-time away goals.
- **FTR**: Full-time result (H = Home Win, D = Draw, A = Away Win).

## Methodology
To predict home wins, the project follows these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, encoding categorical variables like team names, and handling missing or invalid data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting the most relevant features, including the home and away team codes, half-time goals, and more.
3. **Model Selection**: Using a **Random Forest classifier** to train a model based on the processed data. This model helps in understanding the relationships between the teams and predicting whether the home team will win.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model’s performance is evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, and a **confusion matrix** to measure its ability to correctly predict home wins.

## Why La Liga?
Being a soccer fan, I've followed various leagues, but La Liga has always held a special place in my heart, especially with legendary clubs like **Real Madrid** and **FC Barcelona**. My love for La Liga, combined with the desire to apply machine learning to a subject I’m passionate about, made it the perfect choice for this project. Additionally, Real Madrid's iconic performances in La Liga further fueled my interest in studying the outcomes of their home matches and seeing if the data could provide insights into their success.

## Results
The model was trained on historical match data from La Liga, and its performance was evaluated on accuracy, precision, and the confusion matrix. The results show that the model is able to predict home wins with a reasonable degree of accuracy, though there’s always room for improvement, particularly in understanding more complex patterns such as player injuries or other external factors.

## Future Work
There are several ways this project can be expanded and improved:
- **Incorporating More Features**: Adding additional features such as player statistics, team form, injuries, and weather conditions could improve the model’s performance.
- **Exploring Other Leagues**: The model could be adapted to predict home wins in other soccer leagues, such as the English Premier League or Serie A.
- **Model Optimization**: Exploring more complex machine learning models and optimizing the current Random Forest model for better results.

## Usage
This project is designed to showcase the application of machine learning in predicting home wins in La Liga. If you wish to use the code or modify it for your own purposes, feel free to fork the repository and customize it to suit your needs. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
